Introduction:
The main program firstly takes an user input as name, followed by another input called age. To be noticed, the age will be converted into integer or there will be errors.

Then the program will compare the user entered age with the integer 90. If the user is older than 90, it will print out user entered name and the string "you are old". Otherwise it will print out username and string "you are statistically probably old".
